# Threes-Away-Dice-Game-Probability
A quick empirical test showing the score probabilities of the tabletop dice game "Three's Away" 

-Using the integer Variables in the main function you can adjust the amount of turns i.e the sample size to get more realistic probabilty values.
-This code is using a very basic strategy taking any three's rolled when available, and when your roll doesnt contain any 3's it takes the 
lowest die value and re-rolls the rest of the die until you use up all 5 die getting your score for the turn.
-Also note their is a varible for the amount of die, game is meant to be played with 5 but for curiosity purposes you can change the amount of die to any number.
