A quick empirical test showing the score probabilities of the tabletop dice game "Three's Away"

-Using the integer Variables in the main function you can adjust the number of turns i.e. the sample size to get more realistic probability values. -This code is using a fundamental strategy taking any three's rolled when available, and when your roll doesn't contain any 3's it takes the lowest die value and re-rolls the rest of the die until you use up all 5 dies getting your score for the turn. -Also note that there is a variable for the amount of die, the game is meant to be played with 5 but for curiosity purposes, you can change the amount of die to any number.
